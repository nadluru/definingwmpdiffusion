The diffusion data for this study were selected from the Human Connectome Project test-retest database [1]. A total of three subjects (HCP IDs: 144226, 103818, 783462) were chosen that had repeat diffusion MRI scans, resulting in six high-quality datasets, free of any significant artifacts. This dataset was chosen as a compromise between quantification and inclusivity - the use of this small database still provides enough information to detect and quantify the variability among results with great enough participation across laboratories and scientists.
